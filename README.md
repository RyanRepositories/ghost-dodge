# ghost-dodge

This is a game made in CircuitPython, for the Pybadge micro-controller as part of the ICS3U Computer Science course.
A tutorial for the project is here: https://sites.google.com/mths.ca/ics3u-learningguide/home. It includes the PyBadge setup, code (in the form of 13 lessons) and explanations.

Due to hardware limitations, the PyBadge can only read a specific type of .wav file. If any problems should arise with them, pass them through an audio manipulation software like Audacity and download them onto the PyBadge. This should resolve the issue.
